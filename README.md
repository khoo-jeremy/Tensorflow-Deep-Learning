# Tensorflow-Deep-Learning
Contains course assignments for training deep neural networks in Tensorflow.

This project consists of several assignments completed for the [Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730). The assignments are written in IPython notebooks, and involve Python implementations using the Tensorflow library to **prepare datasets, build and train fully connected and convolutional networks, and apply techniques such as regularization and dropout to optimize networks.** 

These assignments developed my knowledge in file parsing and handling, linear algebra and matrix operations, deep learning theory, and the application of neural networks with relation to computational limits.

Each assignment is organized by topic:
* 1_notmnist.ipynb
* 2_fullyconnected.ipynb
* 3_regularization.ipynb
* 4_convolutions.ipynb

## 1_notminst.ipynb
Involves the download and sorting of the notMNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten letters from A-J with ~50,000 samples for each letter. Shown below are some samples:

The inputs become normalized:
