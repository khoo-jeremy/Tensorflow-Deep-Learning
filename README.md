# Tensorflow-Deep-Learning
Contains course assignments for training deep neural networks in Tensorflow.

This project consists of several assignments completed for the [Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730). The assignments are open-ended and require creative design choices. Code is implemented in Python using the Tensorflow library to **prepare datasets, build and train fully connected and convolutional networks, and to apply techniques such as regularization and dropout to optimize networks.**

The notebooks are organized by topic:
